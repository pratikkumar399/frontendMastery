## Frontend Mastery – Practical Implementations

A personal playground to practice, build, and refine frontend skills through hands-on projects, experiments, and small labs.

### Objectives
- Build real projects to internalize concepts.
- Improve architecture, performance, and testing skills.
- Track progress and learnings over time.

### Repo Structure
- `webpack-lab/` – small experiments with bundling, loaders, and build optimizations

### Getting Started
1. Node 18+ recommended.
2. Install deps in each subproject:
   - `cd webpack-lab && npm install`
3. Run dev server (example):
   - `npm run dev`
4. Build (example):
   - `npm run build`


### webpack basic setup
```bash

npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server

```

### Tech & Practices
- Tooling: Webpack, TypeScript (where applicable), ESLint, Prettier
- Accessibility: semantic HTML first, keyboard and screen reader checks
- Performance: code-splitting, image optimization, bundle analysis
